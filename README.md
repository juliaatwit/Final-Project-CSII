## Description
Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game where the player 
uncovers hidden mines on a grid using numeric clues provided for each 
revealed cell. The goal is to uncover all safe cells without triggering 
a mine. In this JavaFX project, "Chickensweeper", 
allows users to customize the grid size and number of mines. It 
provides a graphical interface with buttons representing cells, 
flagging functionality for marking mines, and reveals neighboring cell information upon clicking.
